# <p align="center"> THE GAME </p>
Lunar Legend: A journey Beyond is 3rd person experience for web browsers. The
goal of the game relies on getting the main character, called Alonso Quijano, from Earth
to Neptuno, retrieving a space probe, the “Voyager 3”, and getting back. The main
problem is our protagonist is not an actual astronaut.
This game is based on the popular book called ’Don Quijote de la Mancha’, wrote by
Miguel de Cervantes in 1605. The main character will have the same personality as Don
Quijote. He has read a lot of books about space travels, so his dream is to go on a journey.
Although, he will lose his mind in the middle of it.
The game would two main types of levels: one of which would consist on a vertical-
ascending platform system, for going from a planet to the next one; and the other one,
also a platformer but in this case with lateral scroll and Zelda-styled puzzles, for when
being in the planets.
On the other hand, there would be spacelogs around the Overworld levels that on one
hand gives the player a hint towards what to do next, and on the other one, either a
power-up/reward or some negative effect.
